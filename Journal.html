							<h2>Week 1</h2>		
							<p> In the first week of the course "IXXN221 - Web Design I", our main activity was the introduction of the course and the participants. In the introductory part of the course, the instructor described the general structure of the course and the assessment methodology, including how the course would gradually shift from a coding focus to a more design-focused component. I was also given a primer on the three assignments for the semester. There were also some ice-breaking activities where students had the opportunity to get to know each other, including each other's names, majors, interests, and where they would like to go. Through these activities, I had the opportunity to get to know the course and the other students better, preparing me for the learning activities to come.</p>
							<h2>Week2</h2>	
							<p>In this week's lesson, I got a thorough and detailed introduction to the course. It gave me a clear understanding of Project 1. And I joined the Discord channel to discuss the course and ask questions with my classmates.

				            <p>This week I created the user role who is Alex.
								
								Alex is a 24 year old male who lives in Wellington and is single.
								He is an international student in New Zealand and is looking to start the new term by correcting his past mistakes and focusing more on his studies and life.
								Alex's character traits include kindness, warmth, honesty and sensitivity and he cares about what others think of him.
								He has some bad habits such as laziness, procrastination, partiality, poor concentration and a tendency to stay up late.
								His frustrations include unfamiliarity with his new environment, chronic unhealthy habits and feeling difficult about his new term's curriculum.
								Alex's goal is to change his habits, including getting out of the habit of staying up late, developing a study plan and adopting a healthy diet and exercise regime.
								
								<h2>Week3</h2>		
								<p> It's been a very rewarding week, in this week's lesson I saw the 'The Pathway' website, which gave me an idea of what good web design looks like. Another important thing I learnt was that I was introduced to several important historical events and milestones in web design. For example, the founding of Google, Wikipedia, and the creation of some important tools and design concepts. During the group discussion I began to develop ideas for my Venn diagram and finalised it.<p>
								<p>By creating my Venn diagram, I was able to gain an in-depth understanding of Alex Walker's user goals and designer goals, and the common goals between them. Users are primarily concerned with improving their habits, including reducing procrastination, alleviating anxiety, improving academic performance, and improving overall health. In order to meet these needs, my goal as a designer was to attract more users and increase revenue by providing a practical, easy to understand and operate platform that offered personalised advice, learning resources and emotional support.</p>
									<p>During the week I learnt the importance of quantitative and qualitative goals and how to set success criteria for my designs. I also learnt how to think from both the designer's and the user's perspectives and use Venn diagrams to explain the intersection of the two.<p>
								
										<h2>Week 4</h2>	
								      <p>During this week's course, we reviewed in detail the various developments and changes in web design from 2009 to the present day. Some of the key techniques, genres and shifts in design thinking that have occurred during this time were explored, which gave me a better understanding of the progress of the industry as a whole</p>
								</p>In order to meet the challenges of next week's course, I have watched lectures on coding in advance and completed a serious coding quiz, and I hope that through these endeavours, I will be able to achieve better results in the rest of my studies.</p>
								</p>Regarding Project 1, this week I created a customer journey map, and user flows. "The Journey Map reveals the entire emotional journey of a user as they make and implement a plan at the start of a new term, from making a plan, to facing challenges, to seeking mental health support. I used this map to highlight the emotional highs and lows that users may encounter at different stages. The user flow details every step and interaction the user goes through during the design process, including registration, information search, integration of the exercise plan, and other key steps. Both diagrams emphasise the important role of design in optimising the user experience.</p>
								
								<h2>Week5</h2>	
								<p>The main task this week was to complete the submission for Project 1, and after reading the requirements carefully, I summarised the whole thing and completed the submission.</p>
							</p>It's worth mentioning that this week's recommended site "SURFE" is one of my favourites. When I browsed the Surfe website, I was impressed by the clear layout. The orderly distribution of information made it easy for me to find what I was looking for, and it made me realise that user experience is crucial when designing a website. The eye-catching buttons on the site were also great, both simple and prominent, and it made me realise the importance of call-to-action buttons, which should be easy to find and lead the user to the next step.

							</p>Finally, the varying shades of blue gave me a professional and comfortable experience, making me more aware of the importance of colour choice in brand communication. Overall, this website not only impressed me, but also inspired some new thoughts and directions for future designs.</p>
							
							<h2>Week6</h2>
							<p>Today's panel discussion on sensory design was interesting, and we had a discussion around how to implement it in actual design. Gained insight into how to design creatively, exploratively and engagingly through visual communication. Creating an emotional experience for the user through colour, shape and texture. This approach to design is not just about looks, it's about reaching the heart of the user.</p>
						    <p>How it applies to web design:</p>
						<p>I realised that as a web designer, creating an engaging experience is not just about functionality or user interface, but more about the connection between emotions. For example, I can use warm colours to convey warmth and comfort, or smooth animations to enhance the user's interactive experience. Additionally, through the clever use of colour, typography and imagery, I can create a strong emotional resonance for users as they navigate through my site. This has made me realise the power of design - it's not just about a look, it's about a deep emotional experience.
							<P>This learning experience prompted me to re-examine my web design philosophy. In the past, I strongly believed that minimalism and practicality are the ultimate in design, and always favoured extreme black, white and grey to showcase my personal style. However, this week's learning has made me realise that incorporating sensory design and adopting richer colours may bring greater positive effects to my designs.
								<h2>Week7</h2>	
								<p>Regarding this week's recommended website "CHICORÃ‰E LEROUX", I really like its yellow-white and dark tones, which give a warm and cosy feeling, which is exactly the same as the warmth of the coffee. The interactions and animations on the site are eye-catching and give people an intuitive sense of the emotions the brand is trying to convey. I also got a lot out of today's class, learning some grid layout and colour typography skills. This will allow me to make a big impact in figma. Layout has always been a headache point for me in my assignment 2, I always felt that I couldn't achieve a balance between the content of my pages and the percentage of images. Through today's study and by referring to these great designs, I have made adjustments to my work.

									<h2>Week8</h2>

									<p>Today's course focused on the requirements of Project 2.2, and by delving deeper into the specific requirements of Project 2.2, I have a much clearer idea of the tasks to come. In the past, I may have held some misconceptions about CMS systems, but today's lesson shattered those. After considering several recommended CMS options, I chose to use Webflow for my Project 2.2.
									While Webflow offers a lot of convenience to its users, learning a new tool always comes with some challenges. In the initial phase, I tried a variety of layouts and designs with some success. For those more complex animations and interactions, I checked out the tutorials in Webflow University, which were very useful and answered many of my questions.
									<h2>Week9</h2>
									<p>Today, I delved into responsive design, file organisation and image optimisation. Responsive design, in particular, is a concept through which I understand that web design is not just about creating a page that looks good on the desktop, but also about making sure that it provides a consistent user experience across all devices.</p>
									<p>Learning about the different formats of images (SVG, PNG, JPG) and their respective application scenarios was a new discovery for me today. Learning about Tiny PNG as a tool to efficiently compress image sizes without losing quality is critical for web page loading speed and user experience.
									</p>In current and future projects, I will focus more on adaptation on different devices, using browser developer tools for simulation and testing. I will also begin to standardise my file and asset organisation, ensuring consistency in naming and providing appropriate alt text for all images to ensure website accessibility.</p>
									<p>Looking back on today's session, I realised some of the details I had previously overlooked in my design, such as image optimisation and file organisation. I will pay more attention to these details to ensure that my designs are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.</p>
									<h2>Week10</h2>
									<p>This week's session was centred around Assignment 2.2 submissions and covered the whole process from design, coding to content management systems. In addition, I was introduced to the Courier Magazine website, which has provided me with a wealth of inspiration and design ideas. Its use of colours, fonts and layouts are very striking and I will be incorporating these design ideas into my own projects.</p>
								   </p>Preparing Project 2.2 for submission .</P>
								    <p>The submission PDF will show my progress on this assignment, including the final design images and the whole process I have gone through. This is not just an assignment, it is a reflection of my creativity, effort and time. I value this opportunity and hope to receive valuable feedback from my tutor. </p>
									
									
									<h2>Week11</h2>
									
										The whole presentation of assignment 2 means a lot to me. Being a designer is not only about being able to do, but also about being able to speak. Actively expressing helps us to grow, express ourselves, exchange experiences and collect feedback, which are all very valuable for designers.</p>
										<p>"After this semester's coding course, I have gained a better understanding of coding. I have learnt many new programming techniques and approaches which have made me more confident in facing various coding challenges. Each class has given me new insights into web design and development in a more holistic way. I found it easier to understand abstract concepts through actual coding practice. Overall, this 10-week learning experience has greatly enriched my knowledge base and strengthened my passion for coding.</p>
						  

										<h2>Week12</h2>

                                <p>As this semester's "Web Design I IXXN221" course comes to an end, I look back on each week and am pleased with the growth and knowledge I have gained. From being ignorant of the basic concepts of web design to being able to apply HTML, CSS, and other tools to web design, this journey has been challenging and rewarding.</p>
								<p>This course is very rich in content. From the historical evolution of web design, to the choice of colours and typography, to how to optimise the user experience, each topic has opened up a new perspective for me and given me a deeper understanding of web design. Especially through the weekly practical assignments and teamwork, I understood more about the connection between theoretical knowledge and practical operation.
                               </p>One of my biggest gains is learning how to think from the user's point of view. Design is not just about looking good, but also about providing a better user experience. Through this course, I learnt how to design simple and practical web pages according to the users' needs, making it easier and more enjoyable for them to use.
                               <p>In addition, the reflection and self-assessment sessions in the course have helped me a lot in my growth. By reflecting on my own work, I have been able to identify and improve my deficiencies, which has led to the continuous improvement of my design skills.</p>
							   <p>Overall, this course has provided me with valuable learning opportunities and I am confident about my future development in the field of web design. I hope that in the future, I will be able to use the knowledge and skills I have learnt to bring more innovation and value to my own personal design projects.</p>
